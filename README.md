## Description

PreWork Study Guide website. The purpose of this assignment is an introduction to several coding languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The assignment is also an introduction to using the terminal window, VS Code, and GitHub.
This assignment was like a crash course in learning a new language.  I'm as exhausted from this as when the Peace Corps dumped me in a remote village and let me figure out the language a little bit before any teachers came along to help.
The first lesson I took from this is perseverance.  I made a lot of mistakes.  In the end, I was able to stick with things and get my mistakes sorted out.
The second important lesson I took from this is to go step by step and follow the directions exactly.  My mind is usually going two and three steps forward, thinking about the next problems I'll face.  In my current job that serves me well, but I do not have the coding foresight and understanding to think that way yet.
